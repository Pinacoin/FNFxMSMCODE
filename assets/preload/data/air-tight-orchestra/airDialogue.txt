:pompom:Hello, stranger! I see you're awake!
:bf:Beep...boop?
:pompom:I know, I know, you don't know what happened. Us monsters are confused too! 
:pompom:A portal appeared and spit you and that girl onto Air Island. You're from the human world, right?
:bf:Beep.
:pompom:Well, welcome to our world! We love to sing and dance. Judging by your microphone, I assume you like to sing too?
:bf:Boop boop beep! Beep boooop...
:pompom:Oh, I get that. We had our monster handlers research what happened while you guys are out, and we figured out...

:pompom:I hope you like guitars!
:pompom:Cybop, start the countdown!
